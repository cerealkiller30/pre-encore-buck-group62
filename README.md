# Buck Converter - Group 62
This repository contains our (IPD group 62) submission for the pre-event of Encore, where we were tasked with designing a buck converter.
<br><br>
Components used: <br>
<ul>
  <li>CMOS General Purpose Timer - ICM7555xB</li>
  <li>MOSFET - BSC060N10NS3G</li>
  <li>Schottky Diode - MBR0540</li>
  <li>Connector Pins</li>
  <li>Polarized Capacitors - 0.01uF and 35.5uF</li>
  <li>Unpolarized Capacitor - 680pF</li>
  <li>Inductor - 30.6uH</li>
  <li>Resistors - 2.2kΩ, 9.1kΩ and 1.15Ω</li>
</ul>
<br>
Schematic and PCB were designed using KiCAD and simulation was done on LTspice.
